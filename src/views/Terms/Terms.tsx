          <h2 className={styles.sectionHeading}>What DIDsign is</h2>

          <p>DIDsign is a website that allows you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              sign electronic documents with your KILT on-chain DID directly in
              your browser,
            </li>
            <li>
              insert credentials as a part of the signature for these documents,
            </li>
            <li>
              use timestamping to prove the approximate time you signed them,
            </li>
            <li>
              verify documents that have been signed with a KILT on-chain DID,
            </li>
            <li>
              display additional information about the signers on-chain DID,
              such as e.g. the on-chain DID, service endpoints that are
              associated with this on-chain DID and KILT credentials that have
              been made available via the service endpoints.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This works for single documents, or multiple documents.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className={styles.sectionHeading}>How DIDsign works</h2>

          <p>With DIDsign you can sign documents as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>in order to use DIDsign you go to the Website,</li>
            <li>
              you allow the browser in which you use DIDsign to connect to your
              wallet with your KILT on-chain DID,
            </li>
            <li>
              you drop one or more files to your browser where you use DIDsign,
            </li>
            <li>DIDsign hashes the file(s),</li>
            <li>DIDsign hands over the hash to the wallet,</li>
            <li>
              you can now sign the hash in your wallet using your on-chain DID,
            </li>
            <li>
              your browser in which you use DIDsign receives the signature from
              the wallet and
            </li>
            <li>
              DIDsign makes files and signature available to you for download as
              zip or as individual files.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you want to timestamp your signature:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              you upload the document to DIDsign and sign its hash with your DID
              as outlined above,
            </li>
            <li>
              you need to choose the paid option to timestamp the signature,
            </li>
            <li>
              for payment you need to connect to your payment wallet and selects
              the right payment account from the list of accounts (filled by all
              the payment wallets),
            </li>
            <li>you click on a button for signing a blockchain transaction,</li>
            <li>
              the DID-signature of the hash is added to a “remark” and DIDsign
              creates a transaction to store it,
            </li>
            <li>
              you sign this transaction using the KILT payment account you
              previously selected,
            </li>
            <li>
              DIDsign stores this transaction on the blockchain and takes note
              of the block number and the transaction hash and stores them in
              the signature metadata file,
            </li>
            <li>you continue as outlined above and</li>
            <li>
              the download zip or signature file then contains the timestamping
              information
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you want to insert a KILT credential into your signature you
            proceed as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              when you click to sign and your wallet pops up, if you have
              credentials, you can choose to insert one or more of your
              credentials into the signature,
            </li>
            <li>
              after that, the credentials you selected in the wallet are
              displayed as a nested part of the signature of the DIDsign and
              saved inside the signature file. If you want, you can rename them
              or delete them within DIDsign for the purpose of the signature and
            </li>
            <li>
              when you are done with including and naming your credentials, you
              can continue sign the hash in your wallet and proceed as outlined
              above.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You can forward the documents including the signature to one or
            multiple third persons and they as well can forward them. Forwarding
            is done outside DIDsign, e.g. by email or through other digital
            channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any recipient can use DIDsign to verify whether the signature
            belongs to the documents and, if necessary, request further public
            information about the signature.
          </p>

          <p>With DIDsign you verify signed documents as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              you receive a signature and signed files independently from
              DIDsign, e.g. via email,
            </li>
            <li>
              you drop the received signature and signed files as individual
              files or zip into your browser where you use DIDsign,
            </li>
            <li>
              DIDsign in your browser checks if the signature comes from the
              signer’s on-chain DID and if it is the signature specific for the
              uploaded files,
            </li>
            <li>
              if the signature was timestamped, the block number and the
              transaction hash are extracted from the metadata and used to query
              the block information via the KILT SDK API. The block contains the
              rough timestamp of its creation time, and DIDsign confirms that
              the document was signed no later than this time.
            </li>
            <li>
              DIDsign shows result of check, signature and the signer’s on-chain
              DID and – if applicable – the timestamp,
            </li>
            <li>
              if the signer linked service endpoints to their on-chain DID, they
              will be displayed,
            </li>
            <li>
              you can request DIDsign to fetch credentials from those custom
              service endpoints,
            </li>
            <li>
              DIDsign tries to access those credentials, to verify them and to
              show the verification result and
            </li>
            <li>
              with the information received you can check, if the displayed data
              matches your requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className={styles.sectionHeading}>Your Commitments</h2>

          <p>
            You confirm that you are entitled for usage of the documents and
            signatures and your usage of these do not violate the rights of
            third parties, neither in the signing nor in the verifying process.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have signed a document with an on-chain DID that is no longer
            yours as you have actually lost, sold or otherwise relinquished it
            or suspect its fraudulent use, you will immediately terminate the
            use of this signature and all documents signed with it in order to
            avoid giving the wrong impression to the public or third parties.
            You will also inform anyone who was relying on your signature of the
            changes occurred or even warn them, in case you have ongoing
            relationships with them. We accept no liability in this respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a verifier, you will determine for your purpose if and to what
            extent you will trust received data – depending on your legal,
            business or other requirements, you will determine, if the documents
            signed with a certain on-chain DID represent enough trust that these
            are coming from the right person/entity or if you need further
            documents of proof and which ones for example in regards to their
            identity. As these processes are defined outside of the Software, we
            accept no liability in this respect.

          <h2 className={styles.sectionHeading}>Liability</h2>

          <p>
            The KILT Foundation is liable for damages that are based on an
            intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by the KILT
            Foundation, its legal representatives or various agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a breach of essential contractual duties, the KILT
            Foundation shall only be liable for the contractually typical,
            foreseeable damage if this was simply cause by negligence.
            Significant contractual obligations are those whose fulfilment
            enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and
            whose compliance you can regularly rely on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The limitation of the two preceding paragraphs also apply to the
            legal representatives and various agents of the KILT Foundation , if
            claims are asserted directly against them. The liability limitations
            resulting from the two preceding paragraphs do not apply insofar as
            the KILT Foundation fraudulently concealed the defect or assumed a
            guarantee for the quality of DIDsign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liability for culpable injury to life, limb and health and liability
            under Product Liability Act remain unaffected.

          <p>
            The following risk information contains a list of risks associated
            with the use of DIDsign. The list is not exhaustive. It is not
            excluded that further unknown or unpredictable risks exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Independent of the creation of signed documents via DIDsign but also
            to prevent others from using secret or personal documents, please
            always keep the password and other access data to your devices,
            cloud solution and other data storage safe. Also, just like with any
            other document, only send your signed documents to someone you trust
            that they respect your privacy and to someone how will not forward
            your personal data to anyone else or lose or publish it in any way
            detrimental to your privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            DIDsign is used via the Website and its services are accessed via
            your wallet – please check all the information, instruction and
            warnings given about your wallet by its provider and closely follow
            the advice given. Always ensure that you do not lose your access
            data to your wallet and keep access to your wallet as well as the
            values and credentials stored in it safe from access by others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The on-chain DID used for signing communicates with the KILT
            blockchain and depends on its functionality in regard to the proof
            of validity of your credentials. Errors, dysfunctionalities,
            including failure of the KILT blockchain or the technical ecosystem
            in which it lives may adversely affect the DIDsign functionalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, service endpoints used to provide additional information in
            the DIDsign process are outside of this website and its
            functionalities. Errors, dysfunctionalities, including failure of
            the KILT blockchain, websites or the technical ecosystem in which
            they live may adversely affect the DIDsign functionalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            DIDsign verifies the cryptographically correct usage of a DID and
            fetches credentials connected to it via service endpoints. The
            verification of DIDsign in regard to a credential therefore only
            refers to the cryptographic validity of credentials and their
            current status on the blockchain. DIDsign does not check the content
            of such credential, the trustworthiness of its attester or any other
            information around it that might be relevant. Therefore, DIDsign
            does not verify the content of such credentials or the correctness
            of their content in any way. To ensure that such credentials are
            indeed trustworthy for the purpose of your verification, as a
            verifier you should always do your own research and for yourself
            check, if the criteria for the respective purpose of use are met. If
            you find one or more credentials or other pieces of information
            included in the DIDsign verification process to be not trustworthy,
            should not trust the verification of the respective DIDsign process
            as such.
          </p>
          <p>
            For timestamping you acknowledge that the timestamp is based on
            block time of the KILT blockchain, therefore depending on the
            regularity of the block times at the time of your signature, you
            will get an approximate time slot in which the signature was done.
            For signature and for the verification process, you need to
            determine if such timestamp is sufficient for your purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that we have no support, service level, or
            other obligations like these hereunder. Furthermore, you acknowledge
            and agree that changes in the Software and/or other information to
            the Website and usage of the DIDsign will from time to time occur
            and that verification for documents signed under previous version
            might at some point of time not be supported anymore.

            DIDsign and in particular the underlying software application may be
            the subject of hacking or other malicious interference by
            unauthorized third parties resulting in the loss, theft or other
            violation of data or change in the Software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the software of DIDsign is published, there is a risk that a
            third party may copy it and unconsciously or knowingly incorporate
            errors leading to potential adverse consequences for the usability
            and functionality of the DIDsign. To ensure you are using the
            original, always use through us directly and if uncertain, compare
            the code with the code published on GitHub before usage and only use
            it if it matches fully with the code there.
